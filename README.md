# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created a clock program that displays 12-hour and 24-hour formats. It allows the user input to add one hour, one minute, or one second to the displayed times or exit the program.

# What did you do particularly well?
The code efficiently handles the conversion between 12-hour and 24-hour formats, displays the menu selections, and controls updating the time based on user input.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
 I could enhance this code by a few improvements like the code is unable to deal with improper user input. The application can be made more user-friendly and secure by incorporating error checking and validation techniques. I recently learn that exceptions can be thrown and caught in a controlled manner rather than using exit(0) to end the application.The code makes the assumption that the user will always provide accurate time inputs. It would be useful to provide input validation to guarantee that user input is accurate.  
 
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
One challenging piece was writing the logic to switch the AM/PM indicator when the 12-hour clock strikes 12:00:00. By carefully reviewing the conditions and putting the appropriate toggling logic in place helped me overcome this challenge.

I consulted online discussion boards, programming communities, and YouTube in order to complete this project. When I hit a roadblock and couldn't figure out the solution on my own, I resorted to online forums and programming communities for help. When I was attempting to understand how to construct a header file and link it to the main file, YouTube came in handy.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
To improve organization and reuse, I believe I will adopt function-based programming. Putting in place systems to communicate with users and handle their input. Calculating with time variables, displaying time in various formats, and manipulating time variables.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To make this software readable maintainable, and adaptive by having the ability to be divided into distinct functions with clear responsibilities. By giving each object a clear purpose and meaning through the use of function and variable names. For readability, the code should be organized and formatted uniformly.
Including in-line comments that describe the function and intent of particular code portions.
